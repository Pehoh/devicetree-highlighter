You can send pull requests via GitHub. Do not edit the devicetree.tmLanguage
file directly. Edit the devicetree.YAML-tmLanguage file instead and build the
.tmLanguage file from it using the Build With: Convert to ... - Property List
build tool in PackageDev. You can also use the key F7 to open up the build menu.
